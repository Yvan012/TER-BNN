# Earthquake Cost Prediction Using Bayesian Neural Networks

## Project Description

This project aims at predicting annual costs related to earthquake in Japan. The end goal is to deliver a simple metric to evaluate a CAT Bond from an investor's perspective. The models used will revolve around the use of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) with mainly PyTorch and Pyro libraries.
